今天收到Writely的邮件，原文如下：

> noreply@writely.com  
>  to me More options 3:11 am (5 hours ago)
>
> Dear zrongzrong,
>
> In a few days, we will update your Writely account to use your
> zrongzrong@gmail.com Google Account registration settings.
>
> This means you'll need to use your Google Account password when
> signing in, not your Writely password (if they're different).
>
> If you've forgotten your Google Account password, just go to
> https://www.google.com/accounts/ForgotPasswd
>
> Thanks!  
>  Google Writely Team

这意味着，今后登录Writely必须使用Google帐户的密码，就像Picasaweb、Spreadsheets、Calendar一样。

这才像Google的风格嘛。
